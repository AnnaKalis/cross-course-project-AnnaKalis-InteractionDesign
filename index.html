      How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web
      security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
      greater than 250 words

    <p id="web-security-answer">
      I would recommend the use of https instead of http. I would convince the
      client that it is important to sanitize all data. And that automatic
      solutions are better than manual, so I would recommend choosing some
      established third-part solutions. I would also recommend strengthening the
      authentication process with not only using the password but also adding
      another authentication code, which is sent for example via mobile phone. I
      would recommend displaying and storing only data which he/she needs. And
      to check webpage using vulnerability scanning tools.
